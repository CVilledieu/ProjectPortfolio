# Project portfolio

This is currently my second in progress project portfolio. I had it on a different branch within the same project, but it was different enough I wanted to start a new project. A lot of the resources are carried over from the first option. 

## Core difference between options 1 and 2
Portfolio 1 is meant to be a single page and remain that way. This was my attempt at allowing the page to grow. At the moment its remaind at one page, but thats more or less just due to not filling it with the content I have planned.
